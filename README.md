# Epidemic_Modelling (COVID-19)

The purpose of this project is to develop and implement a web-based interactive system to help the general public understand government policy decisions through epidemic disease models. 

This can be achieved by using various online graphing libraries (Python Plotly) to plot charts displaying information about the epidemic in a visualised format, and ODE solvers to solve systems of differential equations (SIR model) that will be used to display the progression of epidemics.
